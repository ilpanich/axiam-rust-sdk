## [1.0.0-alpha] - 2026-07-15

First alpha release of the official Rust client SDK for AXIAM. This is an
early, pre-production preview published to crates.io for evaluation and
feedback — the public API may still change before the beta and stable releases.

### Added

- REST client covering the AXIAM API surface (authentication, authorization
  checks, tenant/user/role/resource management).
- gRPC client for low-latency authorization checks (stubs generated at build
  time; no `protoc`/`proto/` needed by consumers).
- AMQP consumer support for async/deferred authorization decisions.
- Actix-Web route-guard integration.
- Strict TLS by default, with `with_custom_ca()` as the only opt-in escape
  hatch; no certificate-verification bypass surface.
- `Sensitive<T>` wrapper that keeps token/secret values out of debug output.
- Runnable examples: login + MFA, REST and gRPC access checks, AMQP consumer,
  and Actix route guard.
